# Naked-Mole-Rat-Algorithm
Naked mole rat algorithm is a recently introduced algorithm in the field of evolutionary computing.
The zip file consists of three files: 1) NMRA: Having the main code of algorithm 
                                      2) mainNMRA: having basic parameters and function plot to run the algorithm
                                      3) NMR_function_details: having details of basic test problems.
                                      
Thanks for using the code!
